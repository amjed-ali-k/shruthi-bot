# What is Shruti Bot

#### An artificial intelligence-powered discord bot with a sarcastic personality that can detect context and respond appropriately. The bot will be designed for general purpose use in a variety of discord servers to increase user activity through comedic interactions.

It uses [`discordx`](https://github.com/discordx-ts/discordx) and [`discord.js v14`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) under the hood to simplify the development of discord bots.   </td>
